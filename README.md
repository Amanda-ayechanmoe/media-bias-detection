#Objective :dart:
The main objective of this project is to utilise a large dataset containing news articles that was extracted from varied soruces to detect political bias in them - either left leaning or right leaning.
This is the classification task and will be performed using several traditional machine learning approaches (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost) and DNN.

#Data Exploratory Analysis :file_folder:
The dataset was downloaded from the kaggle :point_right: https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news and data comes with three seperated csv files. This dataset was created by Andrew Thompson.
